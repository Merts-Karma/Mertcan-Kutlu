<h2>Running</h2>
  <p>In my free time I enjoy running. In London, there are many 5 km park runs that happen every Saturday in many park runs across the city. There are many different ways to help improve your running through either gaining speed or building a better aerobic base. For gaining pace, you can do interval training; this is where you alternate between running in a relaxed manner below your target pace and then running for a distance above your target pace. To improve your aerobic base, you can run longer runs at zone 2 training (65-75% of max heart rate). Doing this for a higher volume will help increase your aerobic fitness. There are many tools you can use to help you with improving running listed below. </p>
